3.5.1 (Unreleased)
------------------

- Remove more deprecated on 3.5 code:

  * zope.app.component.fields module that was pointing to the
    removed back35's LayerField.
  * zope.app.component.interface module that was moved to
    zope.component.interface ages ago.
  * zope:content and zope:localUtility directives.

- Remove "back35" extras_require as it doesn't make
  any sense now.

- Remove zope.modulealias test dependency as it is
  not used anywhere.
